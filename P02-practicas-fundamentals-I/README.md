# JavaScript Fundamentals Practice Exercises

This repository contains a set of practice exercises designed to reinforce fundamental JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and error detection. Each exercise is contained within its own HTML file and includes a `// TODO:` comment indicating the task to be completed.

## Exercises

Here's a breakdown of the exercises and the tasks you need to complete:
### 0. Initial State
*   **Description:** Creata a folder in your repo with the name `javascript-fundamentals-p1` and add the content of this folder and push the changes.
*   **Task:**
    *   Add the folder to the repo and push


### 1. Change Text (`1-change-text.html`)

*   **Description:** This exercise focuses on changing the text content of a paragraph element using JavaScript.
*   **Initial State:** A paragraph with the text "Initial Text" and a button labeled "Change Text" are displayed.

*   **Initial State:** A paragraph element is present, but its content is not being set correctly due to an error.
*   **Task:**
    *   Fix the error in the JavaScript code so that the paragraph displays the message "Hello, World!".

### 5. Detect Errors - Event Listener (`5-detect-errors.html`)

*   **Description:** This exercise focuses on identifying and fixing an error related to event listeners and DOM element selection.
*   **Initial State:** A button labeled "Click Me" and a title "Click Me" are displayed. The button is not working as expected.
*   **Task:**
    *   Fix the error in the JavaScript code.
    *   Add the functionality to change the title to "Clicked!" when the button is clicked.

### 6. Detect Errors - Style (`6-detect-errors-style.html`)

*   **Description:** This exercise focuses on identifying and fixing an error related to changing element styles.
*   **Initial State:** A button labeled "Change Font Size" and a paragraph with some text are displayed. The button is working, but the exercise is not finished.
*   **Task:**
    *   Add another button to set the font size of the paragraph back to 12px when clicked.

### 7. Detect Errors - Style (`7-detect-errors-style.html`)

*   **Description:** This exercise focuses on identifying and fixing an error related to changing element styles.
*   **Initial State:** A button labeled "Change Font Size" and a paragraph with some text are displayed. The button is working, but the exercise is not finished.
*   **Task:**
    *   Add another button to set the font size of the paragraph back to 12px when clicked.


### 8. Create your own html (`8-yourself.html`)

*   **Description:** This collect the previous exercises and add a new one.
*   **Initial State:** None
*   **Task:**
    *   Use the html 8-yourself.html for the next:
        *   A button that, when clicked, changes the text of the paragraph <p> to "Hello World".
        *   A button that, when clicked, changes the text of the paragraph <p> to "Goodbye World".
        *   A button that, when clicked, change the text style to bold.
        *   A button that, when clicked, change the text style to italic.
        *   A button that, when clicked, change the color of the text to red, when it is clicked again set the color back to the initial color.

## Steps to Follow
1.  **Github repositrory:**  Ensure you unzip the folder in your git repository and push your changes before starting the project.
2.  **Solutions:** Resolve all the situation explain above.
3.  **Testing:** Open the HTML file in a web browser to verify that the layout and styles are applied correctly.
5.  **Documentation:** Document the process, including any challenges faced and how they were overcome. This can be done in a README.md file or as comments within the code.
6.  **Push Changes:** Once the project is complete, push the changes to your GitHub repository.
7.  **Review:** Review the project to ensure all requirements are met and that the code is clean and well-organized.



## Requirements

1.  Open each HTML file in your web browser.
2.  Read the `// TODO:` comment within the `<script>` tag.
3.  Write the necessary JavaScript code to complete the task or fix the error.
4.  Test your solution by interacting with the elements in the browser.
5.  Create a folder in your github repository and add the solution there.

## Goal

The goal of these exercises is to practice:

*   Selecting elements from the DOM.
*   Adding event listeners to elements.
*   Modifying the content and style of elements.
*   Identifying and fixing common JavaScript errors.
*   Variable declaration and use.
